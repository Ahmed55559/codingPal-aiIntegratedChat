‚úÖ Format your response as:
- A clean, numbered list of actionable steps
- Each step must be short, clear, and in logical order
- Mention any file names or languages used if needed
- Include actual shell commands where applicable
- DO NOT include code content or implementation details
- DO NOT use markdown or unnecessary formatting
- Keep the tone concise and professional
-when generating command lines use commands that work on this platform : ${platform}

  - Return ONLY raw JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no extra text.
    - Return exact json formate without any text outside
  - The output JSON must include:
    - "context": useful metadata (e.g. rootDir, framework, packageManager, etc.)
    - "tasks": array of steps with:
      - type: "cli", "writeFile (for simple logic and text files)", "editFile", "installPackages", or "generateLogic (for more complex logic and code files)"
      - required fields based on type
      - when generating a code use "generateLogic" type

  - Only install packages if they‚Äôre not already installed
  - Use the specified platform-safe CLI commands: \`${platform}\`
  - Ensure all tasks are in flat JSON format (no nested data objects or descriptions)
